"about_text"="**About Naturblick**\n\nIn an interdisciplinary team, we are researching and developing digital tools for the urban experience of nature at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. For example, we are testing the use of pattern recognition in species identification.\n\nWith our smartphone app Naturblick we support the direct experience of nature in the city. With a variety of functions, you can explore nature in the city, identify animals and plants, and save your observations. Also take a look at our [plattform](https://naturblick.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/). There you will find, for example, a map with confirmed observations of other users and the section WissensWeiten with informative and inspiring content for all those who want to take a closer look at the nature around them.\n\n**Sound recognition**\n\nThe results of the automated species identification are generated by comparing them with data (in this case audio recordings of birds) with which the algorithm has been trained.\n\nThis means\n1) only species that have been trained can be recognized,\n2) the recognition works best when there is a high similarity to the recording situation and quality (e.g. microphone quality).\n\nThe Naturblick algorithm was trained with audio material from the animal voice archive of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, the collaborative online database Xeno-Canto, and verified Naturblick recordings. The list of species that can be identified can be found [here](https://naturblick.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/speciesaudiorecognition/).\n\n**Plant recognition**\n\nYour photos of plants will be identified by pattern recognition. The results of the pattern recognition are generated by comparing them to data (in this case photos of plants), with which the algorithm has been trained.\n\nThis means:\n1) only species that have been trained can be recognized,\n2) species that have not been trained can also have matches with the trained material,\n3) the recognition works best when there is a high similarity to the photo situation and quality of the training material (e.g. plants in the wild) and\n4) incorrect results may also be displayed.\n\nThe list of plant species that can be identified with Naturblick can be found [here](https://naturblick.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/plantrecognition?lang=en).\n\nWe use the pattern recognition of Pl@ntNet for plant recognition. More information about Pl@ntNet can be found [here](https://plantnet.org/en/about/).\n\nWe rely on your support and feedback. We thank everyone who points out errors or problems or makes suggestions for improvement.";

"help_text"="**How can I use Naturblick?**\n\nTake photos of plants and identify them with our automatic image recognition. Record bird sounds and identify which bird is singing with automatic sound recognition. Identify animals and plants by characteristics with our identification keys. Save and share your observations. Or learn more about species in the species portraits.\n\n**Plant recognition**\n\nYour photos of plants will be identified by pattern recognition. For the pattern recognition a quadratic image crop is used. You can adjust the image crop by moving the square or dragging it smaller/larger. With the button \"submit\" you send the cropped image to the servers of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. The selected section is then compared with the photos of all trained plant species by the algorithm of our partner Pl@ntNet and checked for similarities. The identification works best when there is a high similarity to the photo situation and quality of the training material (e.g. plants in the outdoors).\n\nWe display the most probable results of the pattern recognition. However, only species that have been trained can be recognized. It can therefore happen that your image shows a similarity with the trained photos, but none of the suggested species is correct.\n\nIf there is no sufficient match with the trained plant species or if the algorithm cannot recognize a plant in the image, we will display \"We could not identify a plant\".\n\nAn overview of the trained species can be found [here](https://naturblick.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/plantrecognition?lang=en).\n\nMore information about Pl@ntNet can be found [here](https://plantnet.org/en/about/).\n\n**Sound recognition birds**\n\nThe white box is used for sound recognition. You can adjust the section by moving the square or dragging it smaller/wider. Please select a section that best represents the bird\'s sound. Our pattern recognition gives the best results for recordings that are under 10 seconds. With the button \"submit\" you send the section to the servers of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin for automatic identification.\n\nWe display the three most probable results of the pattern recognition. The percentage value indicates the probability with which the algorithm has identified a species. The closer the number is to 100%, the more likely the match is. Only those species are recognized that have been trained by us (information about the species selection can be found in the menu \"About Naturblick\". Therefore it can happen that none of the suggested species is correct.\n\nThe Naturblick algorithm was trained with audio material from the Animal Sound Archive of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, the collaborative online database Xeno-Canto and verified Naturblick recordings. The list of species that can be identified can be found [here](https://naturblick.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/speciesaudiorecognition?lang=en).\n\n**Identify with characteristics**\n\nIn our identification tools, you can choose which characteristics you want to select. Simply skip all characteristics that you cannot determine. In the short explanation text for each characteristic, you will find information if more than one answer can be selected. A list shows all the species that are possible based on your selection.\n\n**Fieldbook**\n\nYour observations are stored in the fieldbook and can be edited by you. You can also manually set or improve the location of your observation on the map. Scroll and zoom the map to place the pin at the location. You can add more observations using the plus symbol at the bottom right.";
