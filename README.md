## Release a new version

* Checkout the `main` branch `git checkout main`
* Sync the repo with origin `git pull`
* Update the version in xcode to the new version
* Add the xcode project file `git add naturblick.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
* Commit the version update `git commit -m "Releasing version <x.y.z>"`, e.g. "Releasing version 1.2.3"
* Push the commit  `git push`
* Tag the commit `git tag v<x.y.z>`, e.g. "v1.2.3"
* Push the tag `git push origin v<x.y.z>`
* Xcode cloud will now build the new released version and add it to test flight

## Design Token
When new files `base.json`, `global.json` or `dark.json` are delivered the following script must be executed

```
xcrun --sdk macosx swiftc -parse-as-library AddColors.swift -o add_colors && ./add_colors && rm add_colors
```

It is assumed that every color exists in global and dark.

# Syncing strapi data during build time
A large part of the content data is synced via ktor from Strapi during buildtime. If the schema has to change (species ie) one has to change it at all places accordingly (strapi, ktor, android, ios).
